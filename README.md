# Gesture-Detection
Allows car users to perform certain gestures which controls the car's music, music volume, visual displays, etc.

The Leap Motion Sensor (from https://www.leapmotion.com/) is used to track gestures. This code keeps track of when each gesture is
made and will forward the data to the rest of the CSH ImagineRIT sub-teams. The code is organized by which gesture is detected.

Gesturing in a clockwise circle turns the music up.
Gesturing in a counterclockwise circle turns the music down.
Swiping horizontally changes the song.
Swiping up and down selects display screens.
Tapping forwards selects a specific item.
